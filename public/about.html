    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello. I'm Erik. I'm 34 years old. I started learning web development in
      October 2025. <br />
      The reason for this was my desire to create a modern, optimized website
      for my business startup. <br />
      By the way, I’m planning to launch a clothing brand. As of October 28,
      2025, I’m taking a Udemy <br />
      course by Angela Yu. I’m also learning from other sources in parallel and
      actively using ChatGPT. <br />
      My goal is to become a confident full-stack web developer. Well, we’ll see
      where this journey takes me.
