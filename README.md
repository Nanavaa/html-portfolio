# html-portfolio
My very first project in web development
I started learning web development in **October 2025** to build a modern, optimized website for my future clothing brand. I created it to practice HTML and to track my progress as I grow as a developer. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
HTML only, and GitHub Pages for hosting.

## ‚ú® Goal
To become a confident full-stack web developer.

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by **Erik Dolenko**
